## Cloning a Disk

Do not use [dd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)).

Use a live linux iso on an external drive. When you clone a disk, you need to make sure that no files are being edited/copied in the background. Using Clonezilla/Rescuezilla gurantee no files are being edited in the background.

Rescuezilla is easier for most people, but Clonezilla has been around forever.
